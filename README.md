iphone-light-table
==================

[tlrobinson's](https://github.com/tlrobinson/) Javascript light table demo (works in mobile and desktop browsers).

This project was described in the 2008 post [Multitouch JavaScript "Virtual Light Table" on iPhone v2.0](http://tlrobinson.net/blog/2008/07/multitouch-javascript-virtual-light-table-on-iphone-v20/), but the code seems to have disappeared. This repository contains the code I downloaded around 2011.

Although designed for the iPhone it also works in a desktop browser because tlrobinson added code to fake multitouch events (see multitouch-fake.js).
